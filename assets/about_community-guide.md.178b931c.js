Our bandwidth is limited compared to the amount of users we have, so issue triaging alone can take an enormous amount of effort from the team. By helping us triage the issues, you are helping us become more efficient, allowing us to spend time on higher priority work.</p><p>You don&#39;t have to triage an issue with the goal of fixing it (although that would be nice too). Sharing the result of your investigation, for example the commit that led to the bug, can already save us a ton of time.</p><h3 id="contribute-code" tabindex="-1">Contribute Code <a class="header-anchor" href="#contribute-code" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Contributing bug fixes or new features is the most direct form of contribution you can make.</p><p>The Vue core repository provides a <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/contributing.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contributing guide</a>, which contains pull request guidelines and information regarding build setup and high-level architecture. Other sub-project repositories may also contain its own contribution guide - please make sure to read them before submitting pull requests.</p><p>Bug fixes are welcome at any time.

If there&#39;s something interesting you&#39;re doing with Vue, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.</li><li><strong>Watch a repo you care about.</strong> This will send you notifications whenever there&#39;s activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features.
